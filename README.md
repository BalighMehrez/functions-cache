# functions cache

This library is inspired by requests-cache <https://github.com/reclosedev/requests-cache> and the whole engines code has been copied and modified from there.

this library provide a decorator that can be used to decorate your functions to be cached.

The main feature that diffentiate this library it that it will auto refresh the cache in a background thread so your cache will be kept fresh.
